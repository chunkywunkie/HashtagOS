Downloading python-instagram:

First download the following modules:
httplib2
simplejson
six

By using the following command:
'easy_install <package_name>'

e.g.
% easy_install httplib2

------------------------

If you run into administrator/write permissions like I did, run this instead:

% easy_install --prefix=$HOME/local <package_name>

You need to add '$HOME/local/lib/python<X.Y>/site-packages' to your $PYTHONPATH
<X.Y> is the python version, the error will probably echo which python version you have

This will install all the third-party modules to this local directory 

Add it by:

% cd ~ # home directory

With favorite text editor, update .bash_profile

Add:
PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:%HOME/local/lib/python<X.Y>/site-packages/"

Save file

% source ~.bash_profile # updates the terminal to your preferences


Now you can run for each of the modules

% easy_install --prefix=$HOME/local httplib2
% easy_install --prefix=$HOME/local simplejson
% easy_install --prefix=$HOME/local six


Also download pip

% easy_install --prefix=$HOME/local pip


----------------------

Creating alias for pip

Go back and edit ~.bash_profile

Add:

alias pip='$HOME/local/bin/pip'

Save file.

% source ~.bash_profile

----------------------

Now to actually install python-instagram

% pip install python-instagram


if that doesn't work try:

% pip install --install-option="--prefix=$HOME/local" python-instagram


Everything should be downloaded and be available when you run python.
Try running the test application in the repository to verify that the downloads worked.
